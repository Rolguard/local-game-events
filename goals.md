# Functional requirements that would be nice to implement:

#### 1. Render posts containing Pokemon VGC events in Sydney

- Contains information such as date in the format of September 13, 2024 6:30PM, event_name, location, event_type e.g. VGC

#### 2. Clicking on rendered posts should give more detail about the Pokemon VGC event

- E.g. Organiser Phone number, email, website, entry fee, description, registration time

#### 3. Users can register to make an account and login

- Sign-up and login page

- Maybe use JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

#### 4. Registered users can comment in a comment section for an event

#### 5. Registered users can favourite or pin events to keep up to date with events they are interested in

#### 6. Registered users can mark as "going" or "interested" similar to Facebook events
